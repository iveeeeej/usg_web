## 1. Project Description

Campus Connect is a web and mobile-based e-governance platform designed to centralize and automate administrative, communication, and service processes of the University Student Government (USG) of USTP-Oroquieta.

The system replaces fragmented and manual processes with a structured digital workflow system.

This system is designed specifically for ONE USG organization and is not multi-tenant.
